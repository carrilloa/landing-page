                    How is this any different from literally any other air. This company lacks the originality
                    that is needed to be successful in such a saturated market. Honestly, even the air that
                    I get for free in my own home is more interesting than this. 0/10 would
                    not reccomend.

                    arrived late, and was super stale. How can I rely on a company like this.
                    If it had gotten here any later I would have been dead.

                    Love the idea, product was ok, but the packaging sucked. 
                    I opted for the extra eco friendly version of packing. 
                    Waited for months for product to arrive, when I contacted
                    customer service, they said it had arrived on time. Turns
                    out, the "eco friendly packing" was literally nothing.

                    Super amazing product!!!!! Loved it so much, so helpful,
                    just as they said I increased my marathon time from 1 day to 
                    1 minute. Worth it, arrived on time, high quality product.
                    Also, they sent me $1,000 in cash for this review. so.
